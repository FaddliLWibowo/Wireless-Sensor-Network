# Router Node
![Router Node](Images/Router_node_with_open_housing_1.jpg)
A router node includes the following parts:
* [SparkFun XBee Explorer Regulated](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11373)
* XBee Module
* USB Power Supply
* 3D Printed Housing

The USB jack was removed from the power supply and the remaining cables were soldered to the Xbee Explorer board. The Xbee Explorer board can be stuck into the four stand offs on the bottom half of the 3D printed housing. A zip tie was put around the power supply cable and placed inside the housing as a strain-relief. The top and bottom part of the housing can be pushed together and are hold together by friction.

## XBee Profiles
The profiles to program the XBee modules of the router nodes can be [here](Xbee_Profiles/). The files are named according to the following scheme: Router_R[Sensor Kit Number]8[Router Number].
